- PID controller.
- Open and closed loop control with PID controller.
- Possibility to plot responses using Matplotlibcpp.
- Test API using plots.
- Basic signals: Heaviside, ramp, rectangle, sine wave.

### Features to be added:
- Testing managed using framework.
- PID tuning.
- Other control methods.
- State space model represantation.
- GUI for easier usage of the app.
